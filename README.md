This is my cross-course project from my first year at Noroff front-end course.

## Description
This is a e-commerce site for a fictitious company named "Rainy Days".
Its a cross-course project from the noroff course, which started out as a design and prototype in adobe XD.
Then it got built with html and css. 
I added javascript to add interaction and later used the wordpress E-commerce rest api as CMS for the products.
It has had some changes on the design throughout the process.
The site is responsive on all screen sizes.

Features of site:

- Vanilla javascript.
- cart-functionality.
- Wordpress E-commerce CMS.
