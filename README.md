# InterActiveDesign_CA_Jonne-Martin-Krosby

This is an assignment i had about a company named rainy days. It is built on HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used no framework.
The biggest focus was that the site needed to be interactive and have a form validation with javascript and a kind of shopping cart functionality.
I Used hotjar and interviews for helping me test and get feedback about the site. 
The site is also responsive and have good accessebility.
